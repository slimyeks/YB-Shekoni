            <p>Alhaji Y.B. Shekoni was a wonderful father to me and my siblings. 
                He taught me most of the values that guide my daily lives. He lived a 
                regimented life. He thought me values that could not be bought with worldly things.
                We lived in a polygamous home but the love amongst us is admirable even to some monogamous homes.
